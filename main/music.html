  <h1><u>Music</u></h1>
    <p>I like to listen to music. I listen to music when I'm doing homework, when I'm studying, or when I'm doing
      something else. I like to listen to music because it helps me focus and relax.</p>
    <p>I listen to music on the radio. I listen to music on the radio because it helps me focus and relax. I also listen
      to music on the radio because it's fun to listen to.</p>
